         Atkins notes that this stretch is commonly referred to as the World's Greatest Stretch (WGS) in the fitness community. And for good reason: "It's essential to help with posture-related pain or for people who sit for prolonged periods of time," says Dan Giordano, D.P.T., C.S.C.S.

         Start standing with your feet together.
         Take a big step forward with your left foot, so that you are in a staggered stance.
         Bend your left knee and drop into a lunge, keeping your right leg straight behind you with your toes on the ground, so you feel a stretch at the front of your right thigh.
         Place your right hand on the floor and twist your upper body to the left as you extend your left arm toward the ceiling.
         Hold for 30 seconds to 2 minutes.
         Repeat on the other side

         It's a good option for people who have extremely tight hip flexors, she adds. "The front thigh is safely on the ground in a position that doesn't cause too much stress."

         Sit with your right knee bent at 90-degrees in front of you, calf perpendicular to your body and the sole of your foot facing to the left. Keep your right foot flexed.
         Let your leg rest flat on the floor.
         Place your left knee to the left of your body, and bend the knee so that your foot faces behind you. Keep your left foot flexed.
         Keep your right butt cheek on the floor. Try to move the left cheek as close to the floor as possible. It may not be possible if you're super tight.
