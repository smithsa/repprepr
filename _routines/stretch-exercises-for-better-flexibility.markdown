         Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent, arms by your sides.
         Exhale as you bend forward at the hips, lowering your head toward floor, while keeping your head, neck and shoulders relaxed.
         Wrap your arms around backs of your legs and hold anywhere from 45 seconds to two minutes.
         Bend your knees and roll up when you're done.
